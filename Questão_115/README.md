# 115. Distinct Subsequences

Given two strings s and t, return the number of distinct **subsequences** of s which equals t.  
The test cases are generated so that the answer fits on a 32-bit signed integer.

**Example 1:**

Input: s = "rabbbit", t = "rabbit"  
Output: 3  
Explanation:  
As shown below, there are 3 ways you can generate "rabbit" from s.  
**rabb**b**it**  
**ra**b**bbit**  
**rab**b**bit**

## Constraints:

* 1 <= s.length, t.length <= 1000
* s and t consist of English letters.
